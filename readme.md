# The PST Management Scripts for Commvault
## circa 2010 (vbscript)

I wrote the PST Management scripts to help manage PST files for integration with Commvault archiving. 

The scripts have not been edited in over 10 years and are written in vbscript which is ancient history.

Their is, however, quite a bit of functionality packed in these scripts. 

There are two scripts. The hound is a login script and specific in its use case. The other script, pstMgr.vbs, is standalone and has a broader set of functionalities. 

Eventually, I will hopefully convert the functionality to powershell but anyhoo....
